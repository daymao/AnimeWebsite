# AnimeWebsite
This is a website in which I display my favorite animes and a surprise show (not an anime) at the end. The website is interactive.
The website contains images of the animes and images of my favorite characters in each one of the shows. If you scroll over the 
character cards, they will flip over and display the character's name and my favorite episode for that character. The website
also contains a table at the bottom displaying some numbers for each show.
